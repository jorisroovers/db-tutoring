# From Wikipedia:
# An outer join does not require each record in the two joined tables to have a matching record.
# The joined table retains each recordâ€”even if no other matching record exists.
# Outer joins subdivide further into left outer joins, right outer joins, and full outer joins,
# depending on which table's rows are retained (left, right, or both).
